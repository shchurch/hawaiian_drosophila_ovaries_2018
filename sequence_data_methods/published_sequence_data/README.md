Published sequence data on Hawaiian Drosophila
Created by SHC in April 2016

## Directories

`raw matrices/` 
sequences as they came from GenBank

`parsed matrices/`  
sequences with the taxon IDs parsed to be concordant

`aligned/` 
alignments for each gene

`trimmed/`  
Gblocks trimmed alignements for each gene

`final/` 
concatenated matrices in fasta, nexus, and phylip formats, including

`all_all` = sequences from all publications, concatenating all genes
`new_mito` = only published mitochondrial sequences

## Code
